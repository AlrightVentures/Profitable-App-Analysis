# Profitable-App-Analysis
I am working as a data analyst for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, and my job is to enable the team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.

The company only builds apps that are free to download and install, and their main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that their revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use the app. My goal for this project is to analyze data to help developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.
